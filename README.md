Abstract

Hypothermia is increasingly being recognized as a major cause of neonatal death in the developing world [1]. Particularly for infants who are born prematurely or are immunocompromised hypothermia causes respiratory issues, increased oxygen consumption, and decreased energy reserves [2]. Thus the proper management of hypothermia is crucial and could prevent between 18% and 42% of neonatal deaths [3]. 
Although many devices have been proposed to combat hypothermia, there are currently no existing designs that fully and adequately meet the needs for a neonatal incubator in a developing country.  We propose creating a proof of concept, low-cost thermostat to regulate incubator temperatures in association with Team InucBaby’s senior design project (low-cost incubator for the developing world). Our end product will utilize Arduino microcontrollers to manage a temperature feedback loop: measuring temperature and appropriately adjusting the temperature via a heating pad. Additionally, it will include options for adjustability and user interaction, including alarm systems, volume adjustment, variable temperature thresholds, graphing temperature history, etc. 



Brainstorming

We propose creating a low-cost thermostat to regulate incubator temperatures in association with Team InucBaby’s senior design project (Low cost incubator for the developing world). This method consists largely of using the temperature sensor on the danger shield and a blow dryer (as a low-cost heat source). Along with using the danger shield to measure the ambient temperature of the enclosure, we also plan on using the piezo speaker and sliders to allow for adjustability and user interaction. The piezo speaker would act as the alarm, alerting the caretaker about dangerous temperature levels. The danger shield sliders would allow the user to adjust the threshold temperature or alarm volume, and the temperature would be displayed on the computer. Additional adaptations would be storing and plotting the data on the computer, coming up with a complex algorithm for shut-off temperature, and adjusting the power of the heat source according to the temperature (as opposed to boolean on/off).


Additional Required Parts:
blow dryer 
enclosure - incubator prototype 
solid state relay
(both acquired from Team Incubaby)
